Welcome to KernelFlow Linux

KernelFlow Linux (abbreviated as KFL) is an upcoming lightweight Linux distribution designed specifically for lower-end systems and everyday tasks. Developed by nqoss and koldfreg, KernelFlow was born out of the need for better performance in existing Linux distributions.
What is KernelFlow?

KernelFlow Linux is a lightweight operating system that aims to provide a smooth and efficient user experience on less powerful hardware. It combines the flexibility and power of Arch Linux with optimizations tailored for lower-end systems, ensuring that your computing tasks are performed with speed and efficiency.
What makes us different?

KernelFlow Linux is designed with performance in mind. We strive to ensure that our operating system operates at peak efficiency, making it a great choice for users with older or less powerful hardware. Our distribution is based on Arch Linux, which provides a robust and flexible foundation.
Desktop Environments

One of the key features of KernelFlow Linux is the variety of desktop environments (DEs) available to users. We include several popular DEs, allowing users to choose the interface that best suits their needs:

    KDE Plasma
    GNOME
    XFCE
    LXQt
    LXDE

Each DE is optimized for performance, ensuring a responsive user experience regardless of the hardware specifications.
Thank you for your interest in KernelFlow Linux! We look forward to building a lightweight and efficient Linux experience together.
